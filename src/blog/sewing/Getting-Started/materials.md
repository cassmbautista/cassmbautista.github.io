# Materials

Here is the list of fabrics that I use for projects and there different use cases:

Breathability of fabric is what it feels like when you overheat on a humid day ....

* Polyester ($):
  * I do not recommend using polyester materials at all. 

* Cotton ($):
  * Best for:
    * Renaissance looking garb
  * Where to buy: 
    * Joan's
    * Goodwill Outlet Store: Bedsheets. Make sure to check the tag on the bedsheet to find out what the blend ratio of cotton is. Do not get anything less than 60% cotton. Polyester doesn't look period and it will overheat you very quickly. 

* Linen ($$):
  * Best for: Tunics and summer fighting garb
  * Where to buy: I buy 95% of my linen at http://fabric-store.com. It typically costs $10-$12 per yard, which for 100% linen is a good deal. Joan's only sells beige as 100% linen, which you can use a coupon to get it down to about the same price, but dyeing it is an obnoxious process that doesn't always result in the correct color. You can also buy linen blends like rayon linen blend from joans for half the price, however I don't like the way these fabrics feel they are ichy and they don't breathe as well. 
  * 3.5 oz - used for light breezy garb like sundresses
  * 5.1 oz - this is what I use for all my tunics, tabards, and tops (Joan's linen is about this thick)
  * 7.1 oz - this is what I use for pants, it is super durable and pretty thick

* Wool ($$$):

* Faux Fur ($$$):
  * Do not put in dryer it will melt

* Fur ($$$):
